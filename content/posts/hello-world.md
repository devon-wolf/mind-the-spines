Hello there, and welcome to this blog's introductory post.

I'm in the process of consolidating and DRM-stripping my ebook library, which until now has lived in several disparate proprietary environments. It seemed like a good opportunity to start documenting this process as I go, since many guides that I've happened across are a bit old, at least when compared to the rapid pace that software changes.

I'll try to break it down step-by-step, and as I add posts describing each step I'll include them in a little table of contents here for ease of reference.

In that case - to be continued!
