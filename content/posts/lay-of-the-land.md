As I begin the process of trying to bring my books under one digital roof, I have ebooks in several different environments. Despite my initial, naive reasoning that if I used a device that reads epubs I would somehow have file portability, over the years I have ended up with a bunch of files that can't be read outside their own walled gardens.

I purchased a Nook sometime in 2011. While I largely used it as a vehichle for DRM-free public domain epubs or PDFs, I did end up purchasing two books through the Nook store: David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* and Nicholson Baker's *The Mezzanine*, both of which were great to read in ebook form due to how the annotations make use of hyperlinking. That Nook died many years ago - I still have it in a box of misfit tech, a line-art sketch of Virginia Woolf permanently inked onto the screen.

I read both books on that device not long after purchasing them. Several times over the years I contemplated figuring out how to make them more portable, but I just, you know, never got around to it.

While still using the Nook, I had also experimented with making ebook purchases via some of my local independent bookstores, from whom I purchased another Nicholson Baker book, this time the delightfully absurd and pornographic *House of Holes*, as well as a few other books that, admittedly, even back then I never opened. These ebooks came via the Google Play store and are somewhat more portable via Adobe Digital Editions, but still require jumping through hoops to manage them as part of a more complete personal library.

It was sometime in 2014 that I discovered that my Nook was bricked. I chalked that up to a learning experience and didn't think much of it; I didn't have intentions of replacing it with another ereader until a visit to the [Unclaimed Baggage Center](https://www.unclaimedbaggage.com) in Scottsboro, Alabama around Thanksgiving of that year, where I picked up a slightly-battered Kobo Touch reader from a bin of abandoned devices. I'm fairly sure I paid less than 20 USD, and I was delighted. I loaded it up with a variety of things from Project Gutenberg and PDFs I'd hoarded over the years and continued merrily along like that until now.

The summary is, as I began the process of trying to consolidate my digital library, I had five books under two different lockdown systems (Nook and Adobe Digital Editions) that I want to strip of their restrictions. (Since beginning this experiment I've acquired a few more under different restrictions that I'll write about later. For, um, science I guess?) I've used [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for managing all my DRM-less ebooks from the start; it's one of the few programs that I've installed on every machine I've had over the last ten or so years, and remains the de facto standard tool for personal e-library management as far as I can see. My goal is to get all my books into Calibre and format them such that I can read them wherever I send their files.

I started this process in a Windows 10 environment, using Calibre 5.40, but I will also sometimes use a Linux machine, currently Mint 20.2 with Calibre 4.99.4. I'll be sure to specifiy my setup where relevant. Off we go!
