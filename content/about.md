This is a site about reading, writing, and keeping archives. I started writing guides for myself documenting the process of getting my ebook library consolidated. I realized that many of the resources I was using were fairly old (in terms of how quickly software changes, anyway), and that it might be useful to share my updates and tweaks to some of those processes. I expect this blog will expand beyond that, but personal librarianship is probably going to remain the focus. Thank you for visiting!

## About the Author
I'm Devon, and at some point I'll put some words here about myself. In the meantime, you can find my code projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/devon-wolf). I'll likely put a contact form in place here, but until then, I bet you can find a way to contact me based on that GitHub link if you really want to.

## Technical Info
This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using a heavily customized version of the [Blank](https://github.com/Vimux/Blank) theme by [Vimux](https://github.com/Vimux).
